- 👋 Hi, I’m @Watcher008
- 👀 I have a strong interest in application and game design/development. Its been a growing passion and career for a few years now.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning and improving on a few object-oriented languages, to include C#, C++, Java, and other languages like SQL and Python.
- 💞️ I’m always looking to collaborate on both games and applications, pending position and bandwidth.
- 📫 I can be reached on my website: www.0-0-8Studios.com -> feel free to look at some of my other services as well.
